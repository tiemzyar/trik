Framework for simplyfying some aspects of iOS development

Author: tiemzyar <br />
Date: 2021-12-19 <br />
Xcode-Version: 13.1

## Functionality

Overview:

* Alert controller extension (easily create alerts or action sheets from any view, i.e. independent of view controllers)

* Database manager (easily create and manage a local CoreData database)

* Big touch zone slider (custom slider with increased touch zone)

  The slider comes with customizing options for its values (min, max, initial, interval) and three different color styles.

* Keyboard animation (automatic view animation for text field entries, when the keyboard and the text field would overlap)

* Easily usable overlays
  * Activity overlay (with info text and indicator or progress bar)
  * Auto destroy overlay (temporary text overlay)
  * Country overlay (select a country from a [complete or custom] list of countries)
  * Language overlay (easily switch the application language)

  All of these overlays come with different options for color style and position.

* Easily usable image slide shows
  * Static slide show (images fade in and out)
  * Paging slide show (slide or page through images)
  
  The slide shows come with different options for button style, color style, position. The paging slide show additionally supports dual image layout. 

Details:

* A detailed description of the framework's functionality (including images) will be added some time in the future.

* Until then you can just try out the example app included in the framework to see the functionality in action.
